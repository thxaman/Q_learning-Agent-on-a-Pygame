# Deep Q-Network Agent for Custom PyGame Game

> **Note:** This project is currently under active development. The code and documentation are subject to change as I build out the agent's capabilities.

This repository contains the implementation of a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** agent designed to learn, play, and master a custom 2D game environment built using **PyGame**.




---

## üéØ Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to engineer a **Reinforcement Learning** agent that learns optimal policies entirely through self-play within a custom-built PyGame environment.

This project aims to demonstrate a practical application of Deep Q-Learning by training an agent that can significantly outperform baseline strategies (e.g., a random-action agent) and successfully navigate the game's core mechanics and objectives.

## üß† Planned Architecture

The DQN agent is built upon the following components:

- **Custom Game Environment (PyGame)**  
  A 2D environment designed from scratch to provide state observations, action space, and reward signals.

- **DQN Agent**  
  Core logic that interfaces between the neural network and the environment. Implements an **epsilon-greedy** policy to balance exploration and exploitation.

- **Neural Network Model (PyTorch)**  
  A deep network that takes the current game state as input and outputs Q-values for each possible action.

- **Experience Replay Buffer**  
  Stores past transitions `(state, action, reward, next_state, done)` and allows training on random batches for better stability.

- **Target Network**  
  A periodically updated copy of the Q-network used to compute stable target Q-values.

- **Reward System**  
  Custom reward shaping to encourage faster and more stable learning in a sparse-reward setting.
